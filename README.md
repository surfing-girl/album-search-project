## Installation

AJAX functions require project to be deployed on HTTP server. You can copy project files from public folder to root folder of any HTTP server. I created a server in server.js file in Express in Node. Feel free to use it. You need to have Node, Express and Nodemon for this to work. Then type **npm start** into command line. The project will be on localhost:3000
